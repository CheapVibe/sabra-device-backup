Inventory Admin

NOTE: All inventory management is handled through the web application UI.
Django admin is reserved for user/role management (RBAC) only.

To manage devices, credentials, groups, and tags, use the web interface:
  - Devices: /inventory/devices/
  - Credentials: /inventory/credentials/
  - Groups: /inventory/groups/
  - Tags: /inventory/tags/

# No admin registrations - all managed via web UI
