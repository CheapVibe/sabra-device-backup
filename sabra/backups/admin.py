NOTE: All backup management is handled through the web application UI.
Django admin is reserved for user/role management (RBAC) only.

To manage backups, use the web interface:
  - Backup Jobs: /backups/jobs/
  - Executions: /backups/executions/
  - Snapshots: /backups/snapshots/
  - Export/Import: /backups/export/

# No admin registrations - all managed via web UI
